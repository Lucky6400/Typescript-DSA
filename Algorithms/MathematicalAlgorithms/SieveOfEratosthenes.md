# Sieve of Eratosthenes

## Overview
The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an efficient algorithm to find all primes smaller than or equal to a given limit. It iteratively marks the multiples of each prime starting from 2.

## Time Complexity
- O(n log log n), where n is the limit.

## Space Complexity
- O(n), where n is the limit.
