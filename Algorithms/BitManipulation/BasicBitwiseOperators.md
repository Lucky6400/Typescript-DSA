# Basic Bitwise Operators

## Overview
Bitwise operators work on the binary representations of numbers. The most common bitwise operations are:
1. **AND (&)**: Returns 1 for each bit if both bits are 1.
2. **OR (|)**: Returns 1 for each bit if at least one of the bits is 1.
3. **XOR (^)**: Returns 1 for each bit if the bits are different.
4. **NOT (~)**: Flips the bits (inverts 1s to 0s and vice versa).
5. **Left Shift (<<)**: Shifts the bits of a number to the left by a given number of positions, adding zeros on the right.
6. **Right Shift (>>)**: Shifts the bits of a number to the right by a given number of positions, discarding bits.

## Time Complexity
- Each operation runs in O(1) time.
