# Subset Generation using Bits

## Overview
This algorithm generates all possible subsets of a given set. The subsets are represented by the binary representation of numbers from 0 to 2^n - 1, where n is the number of elements in the set.

## Algorithm Steps
1. Iterate through all possible binary masks (from 0 to 2^n - 1).
2. For each mask, check which bits are set to determine which elements of the original set to include in the subset.
3. Collect and return all subsets.

## Time Complexity
- O(2^n), where n is the number of elements in the set.
