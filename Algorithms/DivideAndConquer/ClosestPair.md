# Closest Pair of Points (Divide and Conquer)

## Overview
The closest pair of points problem involves finding the closest pair of points in a given set of points on a plane. This can be done efficiently using divide and conquer.

## Algorithm Steps
1. Sort the points by their x-coordinates.
2. Recursively divide the set of points into two halves.
3. Find the closest pair in each half.
4. Merge the results from both halves, checking for any closer points between the two halves.

## Time Complexity
- Worst Case: O(n log n)

## Space Complexity
- O(n)

## Advantages
- Efficient compared to brute-force methods.

## Disadvantages
- More complex than brute-force approaches.

## Use Cases
- Computational geometry problems
- Geographic information systems

## Implementation Notes
- The recursive approach uses the divide and conquer method to reduce the number of distance calculations.
