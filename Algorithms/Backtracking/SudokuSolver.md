# Sudoku Solver (Backtracking)

## Overview
The Sudoku Solver solves a partially filled Sudoku puzzle by using backtracking. It places numbers from 1 to 9 in each empty cell and ensures they don't violate Sudoku rules.

## Algorithm Steps
1. Start with the first empty cell and try placing numbers 1-9.
2. For each number, check if it's valid by ensuring no duplicates in the row, column, or 3x3 subgrid.
3. If the number is valid, place it and move to the next empty cell.
4. If the board is filled correctly, return true.
5. If a conflict arises, backtrack by resetting the cell to 0 and trying a different number.

## Time Complexity
- Worst Case: O(9^81) (in the case of full search)

## Space Complexity
- O(1) (since no additional space is used except for the board)

## Advantages
- Very effective for solving Sudoku puzzles

## Disadvantages
- High time complexity for harder puzzles (requires backtracking)

## Use Cases
- Solving Sudoku puzzles

## Implementation Notes
- The algorithm uses backtracking to explore potential solutions, pruning the search space as soon as a conflict is detected.
