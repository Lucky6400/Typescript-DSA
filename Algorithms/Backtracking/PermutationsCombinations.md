# Permutations and Combinations (Backtracking)

## Overview
This algorithm generates all the permutations of a given string using backtracking.

## Algorithm Steps
1. Recursively permute the string by taking each character and exploring its possibilities.
2. Add the current permutation to the result when no characters remain.
3. Backtrack and try other possible character combinations.

## Time Complexity
- Worst Case: O(n!)

## Space Complexity
- O(n) (due to recursion stack)

## Advantages
- Efficient for generating all permutations/combinations

## Disadvantages
- Time complexity can grow quickly for larger strings

## Use Cases
- Combinatorial problems
- Generating test cases

## Implementation Notes
- This implementation generates all permutations using backtracking by exploring every combination of characters.
