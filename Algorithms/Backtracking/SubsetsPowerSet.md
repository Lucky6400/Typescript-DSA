# Subsets and Power Set (Backtracking)

## Overview
This algorithm generates all subsets (power set) of a given set of numbers using backtracking.

## Algorithm Steps
1. Recursively generate all possible subsets of the input set.
2. At each step, either include or exclude the current element in the subset.
3. Add each generated subset to the result.

## Time Complexity
- Worst Case: O(2^n)

## Space Complexity
- O(n) (due to recursion stack)

## Advantages
- Simple to implement and understand

## Disadvantages
- Time complexity grows exponentially for larger sets

## Use Cases
- Generating combinations of elements from a set
- Solving combinatorial problems

## Implementation Notes
- The backtracking approach allows for efficient generation of subsets by exploring each element's inclusion/exclusion in the set.
