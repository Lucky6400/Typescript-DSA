# Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union - DSU)

## Overview
Union-Find is a data structure that keeps track of a set of elements partitioned into disjoint subsets. It supports two main operations: find and union.

## Operations
- **find(x):** Returns the representative or root of the set containing x.
- **union(x, y):** Merges the sets containing x and y.

## Time Complexity
- O(α(n)) for both find and union operations, where α is the inverse Ackermann function, which grows very slowly.
