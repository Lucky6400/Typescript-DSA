# Primâ€™s Algorithm (Minimum Spanning Tree)

## Overview
Prim's Algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds the minimum spanning tree (MST) of a weighted undirected graph.

## Algorithm Steps
1. Start from an arbitrary node.
2. At each step, add the minimum weight edge connecting a node in the MST to a node outside the MST.
3. Repeat until all nodes are in the MST.

## Time Complexity
- O(E log V), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
