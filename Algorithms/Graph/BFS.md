# BFS (Breadth-First Search)

## Overview
Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the neighbors of a node before moving to the next level neighbors.

## Algorithm Steps
1. Initialize a queue and a visited set.
2. Add the starting node to the queue and mark it as visited.
3. Process each node in the queue, explore its neighbors, and add the unvisited ones to the queue.

## Time Complexity
- O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.

## Space Complexity
- O(V), where V is the number of vertices.
