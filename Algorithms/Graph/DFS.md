# DFS (Depth-First Search)

## Overview
Depth-First Search (DFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

## Algorithm Steps
1. Initialize a visited set.
2. Starting from the given node, recursively explore each neighbor.
3. Mark nodes as visited to avoid revisiting them.

## Time Complexity
- O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.

## Space Complexity
- O(V), where V is the number of vertices.
