# Rabin-Karp Algorithm

## Overview
The Rabin-Karp algorithm is a string-searching algorithm that uses hashing to find an exact match of a pattern in a text. It is efficient when searching for multiple patterns.

## Time Complexity
- O(n + m) on average, where n is the length of the text and m is the length of the pattern.

## Space Complexity
- O(1).
