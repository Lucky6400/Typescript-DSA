# Z-Algorithm

## Overview
The Z-Algorithm computes the Z-array for a string, which is useful for pattern matching, where each position in the Z-array tells the length of the longest substring starting from that position which is also a prefix of the string.

## Time Complexity
- O(n), where n is the length of the string.

## Space Complexity
- O(n), where n is the length of the string.
