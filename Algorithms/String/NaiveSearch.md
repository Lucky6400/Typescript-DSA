# Naive Search

## Overview
The Naive Search algorithm tries to match the pattern at every possible position in the text. It is simple but inefficient for large texts.

## Time Complexity
- O(n * m), where n is the length of the text and m is the length of the pattern.

## Space Complexity
- O(1), as we only need to store the result indices.
