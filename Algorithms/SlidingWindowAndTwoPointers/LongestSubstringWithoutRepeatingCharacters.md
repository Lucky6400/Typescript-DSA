# Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters (Sliding Window)

## Overview
The problem is to find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

## Algorithm Steps
1. Use two pointers, `left` and `right`, to represent the sliding window.
2. As you slide the `right` pointer, keep track of the characters in the window.
3. If a repeating character is found, move the `left` pointer to exclude the first occurrence of the repeating character.
4. Track the maximum length of the window.

## Time Complexity
- O(n), where `n` is the length of the string.

## Space Complexity
- O(min(n, m)), where `n` is the length of the string and `m` is the size of the character set.

## Use Cases
- Text processing, analyzing substrings in strings.
