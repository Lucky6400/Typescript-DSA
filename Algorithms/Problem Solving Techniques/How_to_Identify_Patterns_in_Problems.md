# How to Identify Patterns in Problems

## Overview
Problem-solving in algorithmic challenges often involves recognizing common patterns. Once you identify these patterns, you can apply tried-and-tested techniques to solve the problem efficiently.

## Common Problem Patterns

1. **Sliding Window**:
   - Problems that involve finding a subarray or substring with certain properties (e.g., maximum sum, longest unique substring) often benefit from the sliding window technique.
   
2. **Two Pointers**:
   - Used for problems involving pairs or ranges, where one pointer starts at the beginning and the other at the end (e.g., finding pairs in sorted arrays).

3. **Backtracking**:
   - Used for problems that require exploring all possible combinations or permutations, such as generating subsets, solving mazes, or N-Queens.

4. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - Problems that involve solving subproblems and storing intermediate results often follow a DP pattern (e.g., knapsack, longest common subsequence).

5. **Divide and Conquer**:
   - Problems where the solution can be divided into smaller subproblems, which are solved independently (e.g., MergeSort, QuickSort).

6. **Greedy Choice**:
   - Problems where making a locally optimal choice at each step leads to a globally optimal solution (e.g., interval scheduling).

## Conclusion
By identifying these patterns, you can apply known solutions to new problems efficiently. As you gain experience, recognizing these patterns will become second nature and will greatly enhance your problem-solving skills.
