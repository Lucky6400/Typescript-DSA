# Longest Palindromic Substring (2D DP)

## Overview
This problem involves finding the longest palindromic substring within a given string.

## Algorithm Steps
1. Create a 2D DP table where dp[i][j] represents whether the substring s[i...j] is a palindrome.
2. Fill the DP table, and track the start and end indices of the longest palindromic substring.

## Time Complexity
- O(n^2)

## Space Complexity
- O(n^2)

## Use Cases
- Palindrome-based problems.
