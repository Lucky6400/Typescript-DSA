# Fibonacci (1D DP)

## Overview
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The goal is to find the nth Fibonacci number.

## Algorithm Steps
1. Create a table (1D array) to store results of subproblems.
2. Fill the table iteratively from 0 to n.

## Time Complexity
- O(n)

## Space Complexity
- O(n)

## Use Cases
- Recursive-like problems that can be optimized using dynamic programming.

## Advantages
- Efficient compared to plain recursion.

## Disadvantages
- Uses extra space for the DP table.
