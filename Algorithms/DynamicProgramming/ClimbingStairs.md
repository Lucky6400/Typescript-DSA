# Climbing Stairs (1D DP)

## Overview
The problem is to determine the number of ways to climb a staircase of n steps, given that you can take either 1 or 2 steps at a time.

## Algorithm Steps
1. Create a DP array where dp[i] stores the number of ways to reach the i-th step.
2. Fill the DP array iteratively based on the previous two values.

## Time Complexity
- O(n)

## Space Complexity
- O(n)

## Use Cases
- Problems where the goal is to count distinct paths or ways to reach a target.
